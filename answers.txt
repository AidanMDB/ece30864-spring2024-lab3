a) The product owner is equivalent to the on-site customer or product director. The purpose of the product owner is to oversee and prioritize the development teams tasks, so they are as efficient as possible by overseeing the backlog, assigning tasks and ensuring wok is satisfactory.

b) The Scrum Master is the role that ensures the team is following the agile values and principles, ad the processes and practices agreed upon. They are responsible for ensuring good relationship between product owner and the rest of the team, ensures the team is effective, and deals with obstacles and protects from interruptions.

c) The three types of meetings are daily stand-up, sprint review, and sprint restrospective. Daily stand-up is a 15 minute daily meeting in which the product owner, scrum master and dev team discuss progress and blockers. Sprint review is where the team meets for 45 minutes/per week of sprint at the end of the sprint to discuss what has been completed and get feedback from stakeholders and teammates. Sprint restrospective is where the team meets after a sprint for 45 minutes/week to discuss what went well and what can be improved as well as examine tools and team dynamics. 

d) An epic is a big part of a project such as a new feature, within an epic exists bugs, stories and tasks to show the progress towards its completion. Stories are smaller amounts of work that needs to be completed as part of the larger epic. A Bug is some problem that impairs or prevents the function of the product. A Task is a very small amount of work that is meant to be completed within a day or two as part of the completion of a story.

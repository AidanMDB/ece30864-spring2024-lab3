b) The Scrum Master is the role that ensures the team is following the agile values and principles, ad the processes and practices agreed upon. They are responsible for ensuring good relationship between product owner and the rest of the team, ensures the team is effective, and deals with obstacles and protects from interruptions.

Sprint restrospective is where the team meets after a sprint for 45 minutes/week to discuss what went well and what can be improved as well as examine tools and team dynamics.
